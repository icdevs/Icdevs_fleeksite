## NNS Governance FAQ

Q: When will you vote?

A: We vote on governance issues that have some direct or indirect bering on developers in the IC ecosystem.

Q: What happens if you don't vote?

A: Currently you will not receive your maturity if we don't vote for you and you don't vote manually. We are writing a contract to alleviate this issue..

Q: How do you decide to vote?

A: Voting is at the discretion of ICDevs.org. We institute an always reject canister hotkey to make sure we don't miss votes, but we cannot guarantee we will not miss some votes.
