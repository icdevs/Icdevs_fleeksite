# üó≥Ô∏è NNS Governance

ICDevs.org participates in the governance of the NNS.  Our goal is to vote in the interest of our developer community on NNS governance issues that affect developers.

## Our Neuron

You may follow our neuron **[14231996777861930328](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/14231996777861930328)** via the NNS and we will vote for you on governance topics

## NNS Governance FAQ

Q: When will you vote?

A: We vote on governance issues that have some direct or indirect bering on developers in the IC ecosystem.

Q: What happens if you don't vote?

A: We currently follow the cycle_dao and ICPMN neurons for governance topics that we decided to not proactively vote on.  Both of these neurons are committed to voting on all governance proposals.  The developer advisory committee may add additional follow neurons in the future.

Q: How do you decide to vote?

A: Once [Bounty #2](/bounties/2021/11/01/generic-dao-fork-axon-copy.html) is complete we will be submitting votes to the will of our developer advisory council. You can learn more about becoming part of the [developer advisory council here](/developer_advisory_committee.html).  Our advisory board will make recommendations and then the members of the committee will vote.  Once a majority is reached, the vote will be executed by the system.
