# ðŸ’° Bounties

ICDevs.org funds code bounties. These bounties are meant to be both challenges to growing IC developers and avenues to further the scientific discovery of tech around the IC. You can help expand the number of bounties we can offer by [donating](/donations.html).

## Directly sponsor a bounty:

If you have a piece of functionality that you need for your application and would like to sponsor a bounty, please reach out to us specific details around endowing a bounty.  A 20 ICP bounty can be endowned by [donating](https://icdevs.org/donations.html) 90 ICP to ICDevs.  20 ICP goes directly to the first bounty, 60 goes into the ICDevs 8 year neuorn and will produce enough ICP maturity to fund another ~20 ICP bounty each year, and the final 10 ICP goes into the ICDevs Admin Fund.
