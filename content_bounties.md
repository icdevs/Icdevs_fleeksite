# ðŸ’° Bounties

ICDevs.org funds code bounties. These bounties are meant to be both challenges to growing IC developers and avenues to further the scientific discovery of tech around the IC. You can help expand the number of bounties we can offer by [donating](/donations.html).

## Directly sponsor a bounty:

If you have a piece of functionality that you need for your application and would like to sponsor a bounty, please reach out to us with specific details around endowing a bounty.  A 20 ICP bounty can be endowed by [donating](https://icdevs.org/donations.html) 100 ICP to ICDevs.  20 ICP goes directly to the first bounty, 80 goes into a bounty 8 year neuorn. From this bounty neuron 2/3 of the maturity will fund more bounties and 1/3 will go into the general ICDevs.org endowment neuron.

## Accelerate a bounty:

DFINITY has awarded ICDevs.org a Bounty Accelerator Grant. For each ICP donated to ICDevs on behalf of an open bounty, we will add 2 ICP to that bounty from the grant. (Maximums Apply)  Pick your favorite bounty and spend DFINITY's money.  Donations are tax-deductible for US Citizens and Corporations.
