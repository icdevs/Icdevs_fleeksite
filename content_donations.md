# ðŸ’° Donations

ICDevs.org is funded by the Internet Computer community.  Raising funds is essential for us to continue to be able to provide the services that are core to our misson.  There are lots of ways to give and the structure of the ICP token gives us additional creative ways for the community to support our work.

## Mint ICDV - The ICDevs token 

$ICDV is a utility token that is used to provide cryptographic proof of donation to ICDevs.org. I has no financial value and anyone minting the token should expect to receive no value other than social proof and self-satisfaction of contributing to public good. We hope to do fun things in the future for $ICDV holders, but there should be no expectation of financial gain or future value. If you mint $ICDV and you are a US Citizen, reach out with your block number on the ICP ledger and your tax payer information and we will get a 501c3 Tax letter to you so that you can deduct the donation on your taxes.

For each ICP donated there is 1000x bonus. 1 ICP = 1_000 ICDV. (Applies to the first 1000 ICP donated).

Currently Donations are supported through <a href="https://plugwallet.ooo/" target="_blank">Plug Wallet</a>. Follow the link to install and then send ICP from your exchange or from <a href="https://nns.ic0.app" target="_blank">the Network Nervous System.</a>

You can add the ICDV Token to your favorite wallet by adding a custom ICRC-1 token with the canister ID agtsn-xyaaa-aaaag-ak3kq-cai.

## Giving Levels

2. Developer Advisor -  12 Liquid ICP or Dedicate a 50+ ICP Neuron(minimum lock 2 years) - This is a bit high because the maturity takes a long time to be claimable at low ICP levels.  We are trying to keep this at ~$100/year and the purpose is to show a long term commitment to the IC.

## Dedicate a Neuron

The following instructions may not still be relevant. If you would like to dedicate a neuron, please contact us.

### Step 1. Add ICdevs.org as a hot key to your neuron(so we can see id):

#### using dfx:

Replace YOUR_NEURON_HERE in the following string, then run the command:


dfx canister --network=ic --no-wallet call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron "(record {id=opt (record {id=YOUR_NEURON_HERE:nat64}); command=opt (variant {Configure=(record {operation=opt (variant {AddHotKey=record {new_hot_key=opt principal \"ufef3-ic2bp-enpmy-5ezyw-z4p5q-mzgsv-w24y3-2v2b6-ktjpk-cjik4-kae\"}})})})})"


#### using nns:

Navigate to your neuron and click "Add Hotkey".

Enter: ufef3-ic2bp-enpmy-5ezyw-z4p5q-mzgsv-w24y3-2v2b6-ktjpk-cjik4-kae

### Step 2. Follow our neuron for your "Manage neuron topic"

#### using dfx:

Replace YOUR_NEURON_HERE in the following string, then run the command:


dfx canister --network=ic --no-wallet call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron "(record {id=opt (record {id=YOUR_NEURON_HERE:nat64}); command=opt (variant {Follow=record {topic=1:int32; followees=vec {record{id=14231996777861930328:nat64}}}})})"


Step 2. Follow our neuron for your "Manage neuron topic"

#### using nns:

Follow Neuron 14231996777861930328 for the Manage Neuron Topic(instructions). This is a bit more complicated as it still requires using the web console. Using chrome:

1. Log into the NNS and navigate to the neuron you want to dedicate.
2. Right click and "Inspect"
3. Go to the Sources Tab and navigate to top/nns.ic0.app/assets/build/EditFollowNeurons......js
4. Search for "followee: s.id" 
5. Add a breakpoint on the await line right above this by clicking the dash in the gutter of the interface. This line should say something like "await e({
6. Leave the console open and go to the "Following" box.
7. Click Edit Followees.
8. Click A topic for which you have 0 followees. ie "Exchange Rate"
9. Expand the topic and click Add Followee
10. Put 14231996777861930328 in the Followee Address box and click "Follow Neuron".
11. Your breakpoint should trigger.
12. Goto the variables panel on the right, Look for "Scope" and expand "closure".
13. Change the variable a to 1.
14. Click the "play" button.
15. Confirm that your neuron now follows 14231996777861930328 for the Manage Neuron Topic.

Please let us know that you've dedicated your neuron or add our neuron as a hot key on your neuron.
