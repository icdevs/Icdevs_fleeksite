## Dedicate a Neuron

### Step 1. Add ICdevs.org as a hot key to your neuron(so we can see id):

#### using dfx:

Replace YOUR_NEURON_HERE in the following string, then run the command:


dfx canister --network=ic --no-wallet call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron "(record {id=opt (record {id=YOUR_NEURON_HERE:nat64}); command=opt (variant {Configure=(record {operation=opt (variant {AddHotKey=record {new_hot_key=opt principal \"ufef3-ic2bp-enpmy-5ezyw-z4p5q-mzgsv-w24y3-2v2b6-ktjpk-cjik4-kae\"}})})})})"


#### using nns:

Navigate to your neuron and click "Add Hotkey".

Enter: ufef3-ic2bp-enpmy-5ezyw-z4p5q-mzgsv-w24y3-2v2b6-ktjpk-cjik4-kae

### Step 2. Follow our neuron for your "Manage neuron topic"

#### using dfx:

Replace YOUR_NEURON_HERE in the following string, then run the command:


dfx canister --network=ic --no-wallet call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron "(record {id=opt (record {id=YOUR_NEURON_HERE:nat64}); command=opt (variant {Follow=record {topic=1:int32; followees=vec {record{id=14231996777861930328:nat64}}}})})"


Step 2. Follow our neuron for your "Manage neuron topic"

#### using nns:

Follow Neuron 14231996777861930328 for the Manage Neuron Topic(instructions). This is a bit more complicated as it still requires using the web console. Using chrome:

1. Log into the NNS and navigate to the neuron you want to dedicate.
2. Right click and "Inspect"
3. Go to the Sources Tab and navigate to top/nns.ic0.app/ic_agent.js
4. Search for "this.follow = async (request)" (about line 1793)
5. Add a breakpoint on the next line by clicking the line number. This line should say something like "const rawRequest = this.requestConverters.fromFollowRequest(request)"
6. Leave the console open and go to the "Following" box.
7. Click Edit Followees.
8. Click A topic for which you have 0 followees. ie "Exchange Rate"
9. Expand the topic and click Add Followee
10. Put 14231996777861930328 in the Followee Address box and click "Follow Neuron".
11. Your breakpoint should trigger.
12. Hold your mouse over the 'request' variable on the line. This should bring up an interface to edit the properties of the request.
13. Change the topic to 1.
14. Click the "play" button.
15. Confirm that your neuron now follows 14231996777861930328 for the Manage Neuron Topic.
