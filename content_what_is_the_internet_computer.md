# ♾️ What is the Internet Computer

From [https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/concepts/what-is-ic](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/concepts/what-is-ic)#

The Internet Computer is a blockchain that enables developers, organizations, and entrepreneurs to build and deploy secure, autonomous, and tamper-proof software programs.

As an application developer, you might find it useful to think of the Internet Computer as providing the following key elements:

An open communication protocol that enables general-purpose computations to run transparently directly on the internet
A network that runs the protocol to provide computing capacity—for example, the hardware, CPU, and memory required to run programs—through independent data centers.
A globally-accessible and scalable blockchain platform for running software applications.

ICDevs.org believes in a future where a significant portion of enterprise and consumer information management and commerces occurs with the Internet Computer involved. Our goal is that most people will be using the Internet Computer without knowing that they are doing so. To reach this goal we need a significant number of well-trained and well-equipped developers to build the infrastructure that seamlessly melds real-world activity into trustless computing infrastructure.
