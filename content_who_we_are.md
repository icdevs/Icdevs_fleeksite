# 🖥️  Who we are:

ICDevs.org (registered as The Internet Computer Developers Education and Discovery Corporation) is a 501(c)3 Texas Non-profit.

ICDevs.org seeks to provide the general public with
* 🏘️  **community organization**
* 📖  **educational resources**
* 💰 **funding**
* 🔬 **scientific discovery**

... for the use and development of the Internet Computer and related technologies. It pursues activities such as

* **educational symposiums**
* **conferences**
* **educational material development**
* **scientific and technology development**
* **developer funding**
* **open-source systems funding**
* **strategic community organization**.

ICDevs.org is completely independent from the DFINITY Foundation and the ICA. Our goal is to further diversify and decentralize the Internet Computer ecosystem. By providing a United States-based non-profit organization we open up new, tax-advantaged ways, for US-based proponents of the Internet Computer to organize their resources and influence to advance the Ideals of the Internet Computer.
