Section 10. Action By Directors without Meeting

Any action required by the Texas Business Organizations Code to be taken at a meeting of the
Board of Directors, or any action which may be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or
any committee, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to
be taken, shall be signed by all the Board of Directors entitled to vote with respect to the subject
matter thereof, or all of the members of the committee, as the case may be. Such consent shall have
the same force and effect as a unanimous vote.

If the Corporation's Certificate of Formation so provides, any action required by the Texas
Business Organizations Code to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any action that
may be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors of any committee may be taken without a
meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, is signed by a sufficient number
of Board of Directors or committee members as would be necessary to take that action at a meeting
at which all of the Board of Directors or members of the committee were present and voted.
Each written consent shall bear the date of signature of each Director or committee member who
signs the consent. A written consent signed by less than all of the Board of Directors or committee
members is not effective to take the action that is the subject of the consent unless, within sixty
(60) days after the date of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner
required by this section, a consent or consents signed by the required number of Board of Directors
or committee members is delivered to the Corporation at its registered office, registered agent,
principal place of business, transfer agent, registrar, exchange agent, or an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings of Board of Directors
or committees are recorded. Delivery shall be by hand or certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. Delivery to the Corporation's principal place of business shall be addressed to the
President or principal executive officer of the Corporation.


Prompt notice of the taking of any action by Board of Directors or a committee without a meeting
by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to all Board of Directors or committee
members who did not consent in writing to the action.
If any action by Board of Directors or a committee is taken by written consent signed by less than
all of the Board of Directors or committee members, any articles or documents filed with the
Secretary of State as a result of the taking of the action shall state, in lieu of any statement required
by law concerning any vote of the Board of Directors or committee members, that written consent
has been given in accordance with the provisions of section 6.202 of the Texas Business
Organizations Code and that any written notice required by such section has been given.
A telegram, telex, cablegram, electronic mail, or similar transmission by a Director or member of
a committee or a photographic, photostatic, facsimile, or similar reproduction of a writing signed
by a Director or member of a committee shall be regarded as signed by the Director or member of
a committee for purposes of this section.

Section 11. Confidentiality

Directors shall not discuss or disclose information about the Corporation or its activities to any
person or entity unless such information is already a matter of public knowledge, such person or
entity has a need to know, or the disclosure of such information is in furtherance of the
Corporations’ purposes, or can reasonably be expected to benefit the Corporation. Directors shall
use discretion and good business judgment in discussing the affairs of the Corporation with third
parties. Without limiting the foregoing, Directors may discuss upcoming fundraisers and the
purposes and functions of the Corporation, including but not limited to accounts on deposit in
financial institutions.

Each Director shall execute a confidentiality agreement consistent herewith upon being voted onto
and accepting appointment to the Board of Directors.

possess the desire to serve the community and support the work of the Corporation by providing
expertise and professional knowledge. Members of the Advisory Council shall comply with the
confidentiality policy set forth herein and shall sign a confidentiality agreement consistent
therewith upon being voted onto and accepting appointment to the Advisory Council.

Section 13. Removal.

Any member of the Board of Directors or members of the Advisory Council may be removed with
or without cause, at any time, by vote of at least three-quarters (3/4) of the members of the Board
of Directors if in their judgment the best interest of the Corporation would be served thereby. Each
member of the Board of Directors must receive written notice of the proposed removal at least ten
(10) days in advance of the proposed action. An officer who has been removed as a member of
the Board of Directors shall automatically be removed from office.

Members of the Board of Directors who are removed for failure to meet the minimum requirements

The Executive Director will have the sole authority to hire, retain, and release other staff that is
necessary for the pursuit of the corporate purpose set forth in Article II, Section 2. All hires are
subject to the restrictions set forth in Article VII (Conflict of Interest and Compensation).

ARTICLE VII. – Conflict of Interest and Compensation

Section 1: Purpose
The purpose of the conflict-of-interest policy is to protect this tax-exempt organization’s
(Organization) interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that
might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the Organization or might result in a
possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any
applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and
charitable organizations.

Section 2: Definitions

a. Interested Person
Any director, principal officer, executive director, or member of a committee with
governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined
below, is an interested person.

b. Financial Interest

A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business,
investment, or family:

1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the
Organization has a transaction or arrangement,

2. A compensation arrangement with the Organization or with any entity or
individual with which the Organization has a transaction or arrangement, or

3. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation
arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Organization is
negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not
insubstantial.

A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under Article III, Section 2, a person
who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board
or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

Section 3. Procedures

a. Duty to Disclose. In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an
interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the
opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with
governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.

b. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. After disclosure of the financial
interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she
shall leave the governing board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict
of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall
decide if a conflict of interest exists.

c. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest

1. An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or
committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during
the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the
possible conflict of interest.

2. The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate,
appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the
proposed transaction or arrangement.

3. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall
determine whether the Organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a more
advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not
give rise to a conflict of interest.

4. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably
possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing
board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors
whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Organization’s best interest, for its
own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above
determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction
or arrangement.

d. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy

1. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a
member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform
the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to
explain the alleged failure to disclose.

2. If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further
investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee
determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of
interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

Section 4. Records of Proceedings

The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board delegated powers shall contain:

a. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial
interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the
financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present,
and the governing board’s or committee’s decision as to whether a conflict of interest in
fact existed.

b. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to
the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to
the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection
with the proceedings.

Section 5. Compensation

a. A voting member of the governing board who receives compensation, directly or
indirectly, from the Organization for services is precluded from voting on matters
pertaining to that member’s compensation.

b. A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation
matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Organization for
services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.

c. No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose jurisdiction
includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from
the Organization, either individually or collectively, is prohibited from providing
information to any committee regarding compensation.

Section 6. Annual Statements

Each director, principal officer and member of a committee with governing board delegated
powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person:

a. Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,

b. Has read and understands the policy,

c. Has agreed to comply with the policy, and

d. Understands the Organization is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax
exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-
exempt purposes.

Section 7. Periodic Reviews

To ensure the Organization operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not
engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be
conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:

a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on
competent survey information, and the result of arm’s length bargaining.

b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management
organizations conform to the Organization’s written policies, are properly recorded, reflect
reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and
do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit transaction.

Section 8. Use of Outside Experts

When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, the Organization may, but
need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing
board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.

ARTICLE VIII. INDEMNIFICATION

Section 1. General

To the full extent authorized under the laws of the State of Texas, the corporation shall indemnify
any director, officer, employee, or agent, or former member, director, officer, employee, or agent
of the corporation, or any person who may have served at the corporation’s request as a director
or officer of another corporation (each of the foregoing members, directors, officers, employees,
agents, and persons is referred to in this Article individually as an “indemnitee”), against expenses
actually and necessarily incurred by such indemnitee in connection with the defense of any action,
suit, or proceeding in which that indemnitee is made a party by reason of being or having been
such member, director, officer, employee, or agent, except in relation to matters as to which that
indemnitee shall have been adjudged in such action, suit, or proceeding to be liable for negligence
or misconduct in the performance of a duty. The foregoing indemnification shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an indemnitee may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement,
resolution of the Board of Directors, or otherwise.

Section 2. Expenses

Expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in defending a civil or criminal action,
suit, or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
action, suit, or proceeding, if authorized by the Board of Directors, upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder.

Section 3. Insurance

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or another arrangement on behalf of any
person who is or was a member, director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or who is
or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor,
trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation,
employee benefit plan, other enterprise, or other entity, against any liability asserted against him
or her and incurred by him or her in such a capacity or arising out of his or her status as such a
person, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against that
liability. Without limiting the power of the Corporation to procure or maintain any kind of
insurance or other arrangement, the Corporation may, for the benefit of persons indemnified by
the Corporation, (1) create a trust fund; (2) establish any form of self-insurance; (3) secure its
indemnity obligation by grant of a security interest or other lien on the assets of the Corporation;
or (4) establish a letter of credit, guaranty, or surety arrangement. The insurance or other
arrangement may be procured, maintained, or established within the Corporation or with any
insurer or other person deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors regardless of whether all or
part of the stock or other securities of the insurer or other person are owned in whole or part by the
Corporation. In the absence of fraud, the judgment of the Board of Directors as to the terms and
conditions of the insurance or other arrangement and the identity of the insurer or other person
participating in an arrangement shall be conclusive and the insurance or arrangement shall not be
voidable and shall not subject the directors approving the insurance or arrangement to liability, on
any ground, regardless of whether directors participating in the approval are beneficiaries of the
insurance or arrangement.

ARTICLE IX. BOOKS AND RECORDS

The Corporation shall keep correct and complete books and records of account and shall keep
minutes of the proceedings of the Board of Directors, and committees and shall keep at the
registered office or principal office in this State a record of the names and addresses of its members
entitled to vote. A Director of the Corporation, on written demand stating the purpose of the
demand, has the right to examine and copy, in person or by agent, accountant, or attorney, at any
reasonable time, for any proper purpose, the books and records of the Corporation relevant to that
purpose, at the expense of the member.

ARTICLE X. BUDGETS

Section 1. Establishment of the Budget

(a) Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the Board or the Executive Director (if the
Corporation has retained an Executive Director) shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a budget
(the “Budget”) for the fiscal year. The Board shall approve the Budget no later than thirty (30)
days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year.

(b) The Budget shall, at a minimum, include capital, operational, debt service and project- specific
expenditures and corresponding revenues. The Budget shall clearly indicate the sources and
purposes of revenues.

(c) If the Board fails to approve the Budget by the first day of the fiscal year, then the Budget for
the prior fiscal year shall be deemed approved until such time as the Board approves a new Budget.
Section 2. Adjustments to the Budget

The Executive Director shall have the authority to adjust the budget to accommodate for
unexpected inflows and outflows of contribution, unexpected income, and unexpected expenses
between the annual meetings. Adjustments should be reported in the next financial report
Treasurer along with justifications as to how the adjustment seeks to pursue the purposes set out
in Article II Section 2.

ARTICLE XI. AMENDMENTS

Section 1. Articles of Incorporation

The Articles may be amended in any manner at any regular or special meeting of the Board of
Directors, provided that specific written notice of the proposed amendment of the Articles setting
forth the proposed amendment or a summary of the changes to be effected thereby shall be given
to each director at least three days in advance of such a meeting via electronic communication. As
required by the Articles, any amendment to Article III or Article VI of the Articles shall require
the affirmative vote of at least 3/5ths of the directors then in office. All other amendments of the
Articles shall require the affirmative vote of an absolute majority of directors then in office.

Section 2. Bylaws

The Board of Directors may amend these Bylaws by majority vote at any regular or special
meeting. Electronic notice setting forth the proposed amendment or summary of the changes to be
effected thereby shall be given to each director within the time and the manner provided for the
giving of notice of meetings of directors.
