# Proposal

The proposal seeks to have CIGDAO permanently fund an ICDevs bounty.  ICDevs has a permanent bounty funding mechanism where a group can fund ICDevs to issue a bounty in their name in perpetuity.

The CIGDAO bounty will be funded with 2520 ICP from the CIGDao treasury.  ICDevs will use 2/3 of that to permanently fund the bounty in an 8 year neuron and 1/3 to buy YC to issue a bounty.  This will fund an approximately $3,000 bounty to attract developers to the IC/YC ecosystem.  ICDevs will work with CIGDAO to determine the first bounty. We will buy YC for the bounty with this ICP.  As the maturity spawns off the endowed bounty from the NNS neuron, 2/9 will fund buying YC to increase the bounty until it is complete.

Any dividends accruing to the Pool of YC in the ICDevs treasury will be split according to the same split with 2/3 being used to buy YC for the ICDevs Permanent Treasury, 2/9 funding the CIGDAO bounty and 1/9 funding ICDevs.

Once the bounty is complete we will work with CIGDAO to create a new bounty. Rinse and Repeat.  ICDevs will promote these bounties as CIGDAO bounties and we will host a CIGDAO bounty page on our site.

# Benefits to CIGDAO:

- Creates a permanent buyer of YC
- Attracts developers to the YC ecosystem
- Cross promotional opportunities for CIGDAO and ICDevs

ICDevs.org is completely independent from the DFINITY Foundation and the ICA. Our goal is to further diversify and decentralize the Internet Computer ecosystem. By providing a United States-based non-profit organization we open up new, tax-advantaged ways, for US-based proponents of the Internet Computer to organize their resources and influence to advance the Ideals of the Internet Computer.

We propose that CIGDAO permanently fund an ICDevs bounty using 2520 ICP from the CIGDao treasury. ICDevs will use 2/3 of the funds to permanently fund the bounty in an 8 year neuron and 1/3 to buy YC to issue a bounty. This will fund an approximately $3,000 bounty to attract developers to the IC/YC ecosystem. ICDevs will work with CIGDAO to determine the first bounty and will buy YC for the bounty with this ICP. As the maturity spawns off the endowed bounty from the NNS neuron, 2/9 of the funds will be used to buy YC to increase the bounty until it is complete. Any dividends accruing to the Pool of YC in the ICDevs treasury will be split according to the same ratio, with 2/3 being used to buy YC for the ICDevs Permanent Treasury, 2/9 funding the CIGDAO bounty, and 1/9 funding ICDevs.

This arrangement will create a permanent buyer of YC, attract developers to the YC ecosystem, and provide cross promotional opportunities for CIGDAO and ICDevs. Once the bounty is complete, we will work with CIGDAO to create a new bounty, repeating the process. ICDevs will promote these bounties as CIGDAO bounties and will host a CIGDAO bounty page on our site.
