* Developer Type: Individual

* Time Commitment: Days/Weeks
* Project Type: User Interface Design
* Experience Type: Intermediate/Expert - Tailwind CSS and UI Design;

## Description

The proposed Design Bounty aims to rebuild the User Interface (UI) for the AXON application in a Tailwind CSS compliant design template. The current design of the AXON application is not optimized for user experience, and the proposed redesign aims to address this issue by improving the overall UI design.

The redesign will incorporate Tailwind CSS, which is a popular CSS framework that provides pre-designed UI components that are easy to use and customizable. The redesign will also follow best practices in UI design to ensure that the new design is user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing.

The proposed design bounty will require a designer who is proficient in using Tailwind CSS and has experience in UI design. The designer will work closely with the AXON contributors to ensure that the new design meets the specific requirements of the AXON application.

Overall, the proposed redesign of the AXON application's UI will enhance the user experience and make the application more appealing to users. The integration of Tailwind CSS will ensure that the redesign is modern, responsive, and compliant with industry standards.

The current site is built using Next.JS. The developer may choose to switch to svelte or a non-next.js format, but the bounty amount will remain the same.

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn about Axon
* learn about Tailwind CSS
* learn about DAO useability and UI design


## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work building web applications and any other open-source contributions (i.e., your Github).
* Provide a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self-contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

The balance of the bounty will be paid out at completion.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.

## Funding
