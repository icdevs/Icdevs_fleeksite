## Description

YC and CIGDao have generously endowed a permanent bounty for ICDevs.

This bounty is an analysis and proposal bounty.  To complete this bounty you need to:

1. Visit with the founders of CIGDao about the mechanics involved in YC and CIGDao.
2. Use that information to document 5 Dapp ideas that would burn YC. Those ideas should be:
* Achievable - We'd want mvps that can be built/deployed in a minimal version in less than a month.
* Specific
* Explain the token mechanism
* Explain the value to the community
* Provide pseudo-code for the mechanism
* Provide a set of high level user stories for each idea.

These ideas will be considered for future CIGDao bounties.

* learn about YC
* learn about Token Economics and Engineering

## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work writing tutorials and any other open-source contributions(ie. your github).
* Include a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self-contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

The balance of the bounty will be paid out at completion.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.

## Funding

The bounty was generously funded by [CIGDao](https://cigdao.com/). If you would like to turbocharge this bounty you can seed additional donations of ICP to fca3c36aad1afdb8482670b4e644b73696155f18e02d12150ba997a628487abe.  ICDevs will add .25 for every 1 token donated to the bounty. If you want to fund with YC you can send it to cbjuv-smn7s-j5lwu-opgfw-5qbrk-5cbtb-gigcg-wn5dy-enpo7-xvfou-nqe. All donations will be tax deductible for US Citizens and Corporations.  If you send a donation and need a donation receipt, please email the hash of your donation transaction, physical address, and name to donations@icdevs.org.  More information about how you can contribute can be found at our [donations page](https://icdevs.org/donations.html).
