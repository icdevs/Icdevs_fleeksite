## Description

The js agent provided by DFINITY works well for web applications.  It has issues when trying to use it from Android and iOS.  There has already been a good bit of discussion on the issue here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/making-http-calls-from-mobile-apps/5192/25

This bounty will be awarded to the developer who delivers an open source solution that react-native developers can use in their react-native projects.  We would prefer that these template projects become part of https://github.com/MioQuispe/create-ic-app.

The repos can be delivered as either one or two project templates. If two are needed, one should be for iOS and one should be for android.  Developers should target the OS version that would be relevant to at least 50% of OS users(currently iOS 12, Android 10).

Repos should follow the same module signature as other react-native projects and any new components or shims should be easily accessible from npm and yarn.

If specific configuration is necessary then the configuration should be well documented in the readme file.

If a custom js engine is necessary, specific instructions should be provided for how to download, compile, and include the custom js engine in the project.  This should consist of both a description of the changes to the js engine and a script to set up a project properly so that it 'just works' like other create-ic-app templates

## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work with react-native and project templating and any other open source contributions(ie. your github).
* Include a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.

## Funding

The bounty was generously funded by the community. If you would like to turbocharge this bounty you can seed additional donations of ICP to e156fe180f0f6deffa87344390dc45b2e6d4483d4007f6ea8f3f4d89e56fa5d2.  ICDevs will match the bounty 1:1 for the first 20 ICP and then 0.25:1 after that.  All donations will be tax deductible for US Citizens and Corporations.  If you send a donation and need a donation receipt, please email the hash of your donation transaction, physical address, and name to donations@icdevs.org.  More information about how you can contribute can be found at our [donations page](https://icdevs.org/donations.html).

## General Bounty Process

### Discussion

The draft bounty is posted to the DFINITY developer's forum for discussion

### Ratification

The developer advisor's board will propose a bounty be ratified and a vote will take place to ratify the bounty.  Until a bounty is ratified by the Dev it hasn't been officially adopted. Please take this into consideration if you are considering starting early.

### Open for application

Developers can submit applications to the Dev Forum post.  The council will consider these as they come in and propose a vote to award the bounty to one of the applicants.

### Assigned

A developer is currently working on this bounty, you are free to contribute, but any splitting of the award will need to be discussed with the currently assigned developer.

### In Review

The Dev Council is reviewing the submission

### Awarded

The award has be been given and the bounty is closed.
