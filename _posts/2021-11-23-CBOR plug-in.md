## Description

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn how chrome plugins work
* learn how CBOR encoding works
* learn how Candid encodings work
* learn how the Internet Computer communicates with other applications

The developer will need to create a plug-in for Google Chrome in the style of react developer tools.  This plug in should detect when CBOR has been sent or recieved from a server and be able to display that CBOR content in a more readable format. The user should be able to switch between a candid view/motoko data view/rust data view/json view.  This will allow the user to copy and paste the data easily in to test harneses if they need to.
