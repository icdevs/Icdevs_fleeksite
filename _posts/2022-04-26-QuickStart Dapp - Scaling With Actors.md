* Project Type: Single Contributor/Team
* Opened: 04/26/2022
* Time Commitment: Weeks
* Project Type: Sample App
* Experience Type: Intermediate - Motoko; Intermediate - Rust; Intermediate - Web

## Description

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn motoko
* learn rust
* learn how scaling works
* learn how to use canisters to create canisters
* learn about the actor model
* learn how clients access the Internet Computer

The goal of this bounty is to produce a sample application on the Internet Computer.

Goal: Demonstrate the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) on the internet computer using a multi-canister architecture

Create a practical dapp that demonstrates the actor model of programming such that a system produces “actor” canisters that can interact in a meaningful and productive manner.

Reach goal 1: Create a system of trust such that all crated actors can inherently trust each other.

Reach goal 2: Create a multi-tenant system that supports multiple actors on one canister to reduce costs, but can “spin out” the actor once it reaches a certain size/value.

Example A:  Create a token that has no ledger but trades value between trusted actors such that no tokens can be created or destroyed.

Example B:  Create a social application where each "space" can be spun out to its own canister once it has been vetted by the community.

Example C:  Create a defi marketplace that spins out a new actor for each asset traded such that all functions of the marketplace are contained inside the actor.

Your application can be written in either motoko, rust, or azel.  Further, a motoko and rust version can be submitted as separate entries by the same person/team.

The code must be opensourced using the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
