[Forum Link - Discussion]()

## Bounty Details

* Bounty Amount: 200 ICP First Prize, 100 ICP Second Prize, 50 ICP Third Prize
* Project Type: Single Contributor/Team
* Opened: 03/28/2022
* Time Commitment: Weeks
* Project Type: Sample App
* Experience Type: Intermediate - Motoko; Intermediate - Rust; Intermediate - Web

## Description

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn motoko
* learn rust
* learn how scaling works
* learn how to use canisters to create canisters
* learn about indexing
* learn how clients access the Internet Computer

The goal of this bounty is to produce a sample application on the Internet Computer.

Goal: Demonstrate scalability by using inter-canister calls

Create a practical dapp that has a common endpoint (primary canister) that can scale its application by creating secondary canisters and distributing requests across those canisters.

Reach Goal 1: The primary canister provides indexing information such that a client can distribute parallel calls across secondary canisters directly.

Reach Goal 2: Provide a security interface such that secondary canisters can hold private data from many users but only deliver requests to authorized requesters. Attempt to use as few inter-canister calls as possible.

## To submit for this bounty you should:

Create a github repo with your sample application and post the link to either the (dev forum post)[] or the (ICDevs.org dscvr portal)[https://h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai.raw.ic0.app/p/icdevs].

We will start selecting prize winners by April 12th, 2022.  Submission will stay open until we believe we have a sufficient number of sample applications.  Multiple prizes may be awarded for submissions that reach a sufficient level of completeness.

## Bounty Completion

Once your app is complete and submitted, it will be judged on the following criteria:

* How relevant is this sample dapps for the community?

* How well is the sample dapps functionality presented?
* Does this sample dapp help me to build enough? Can I use the sample dapp for a real project? 
* How was the sample dapp written?
* How many goals were reached?

Bonus considerations:

* Are there tests?
* Is the documentation provided (readme file on github) sufficient? 
* A user interface of some kind is highly encouraged so that users of your sample application can get a visual view of how your application works.
