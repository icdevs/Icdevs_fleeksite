[Forum Link - Discussion](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icdevs-org-bounty-20-quickstart-dapp-scaling-with-canisters-200-icp-100-icp-50-icp-multiple-winners)

## Bounty Details

* Bounty Amount: 200 ICP First Prize, 100 ICP Second Prize, 50 ICP Third Prize
* Project Type: Single Contributor/Team
* Opened: 03/28/2022
* Time Commitment: Weeks
* Project Type: Sample App
* Experience Type: Intermediate - Motoko; Intermediate - Rust; Intermediate - Web

## Description

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn motoko
* learn rust
* learn how scaling works
* learn how to use canisters to create canisters
* learn about indexing
* learn how clients access the Internet Computer

The goal of this bounty is to produce a sample application on the Internet Computer.

Goal: Demonstrate scalability by using inter-canister calls

Create a practical dapp that has a common endpoint (primary canister) that can scale its application by creating secondary canisters and distributing requests across those canisters.

Reach Goal 1: The primary canister provides indexing information such that a client can distribute parallel calls across secondary canisters directly.

Reach Goal 2: Provide a security interface such that secondary canisters can hold private data from many users but only deliver requests to authorized requesters. Attempt to use as few inter-canister calls as possible.

Your application can be written in either motoko or rust.  Further, a motoko and rust version can be submitted as seperate entries by the same person/team.

The code must be opensourced using the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Results

We have had 5 amazing submissions for the QuickStart Bounty on scaling with canisters. Do you want BigMap? BigMap is in the bones of most of these projects. They are a great way to get started and explore how to use canisters to expand the scalability of your smartcontracts.

Weâ€™ve decided to award all 5 projects with the 1st place prize of 400 ICP. Congrats to the winners:

Scaled Storage is a generic distributed hash table tailored for the internet computer. It can scale to possibly an infinite amount of canisters, with a worst-case scenario of one inter-canister call and usually a best case of zero. The client side never needs prior knowledge of all canisters holding data, but instead just the canister id of any one of the canisters. - The repo: GitHub - scroobius-pip/scaled_storage 1
