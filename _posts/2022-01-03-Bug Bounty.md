* Issue Type: Bug Bounty

## Description

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn about the Issues ICDevs has funded
* learn about motoko, rust, and IC Development


ICDevs.org funds bounties that are completed by the community. It is often difficult to get developers to review and critique pull requests.  This Bounty provides funds to incentivize those developers.

This bounty follows the taxonomy listed at https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy.  Bounties are paid out on the following schedule:

* P1: 50% of fund
* P2: 25% of fund
* P3: 10% of fund
* P4: 5% of fund
* P5: 1% of fund
* Other: At ICDevs Discretion

To claim the award you must notify admin@icdevs.org of the bug. If the bug has security or data implications ICDevs.org will work with you to notify the project owner of the bug and to find a solution. Once the bug has been addressed the person claiming the bounty will need to write a post-mortem issue as an issue on the source control application(ie github) explaining how they found the bug, the implications of the bug, and the resolution that was created.

# Matches

Acclerator Fund: - 20 ICP Direct

# Endowments

The Bug Bounty needs to be steadily refreshed with value. In order to do this we need endowments of the bug bounty from individual developers, companies, and DAOs in the IC Ecosystem. An endowment can be of any size, but we recommend at least 100 ICP.  20% of an endowment will be immediately put into the Bug Bounty Fund and the remaining 80% will be contributed to the Bug Bounty Neuron, an 8 year locked neuron.  2/3 of the proceeds of this neuron will fund the Bug Bounty and the remaining 1/3 will be contributed to the general ICDevs.org endowment neuron that funds other ICDevs activities. The first 5 100 ICP Endowments will be be matched by the ICDevs.org DFINITY Accelrator grant with an additional 10 ICP into the bug bounty.
