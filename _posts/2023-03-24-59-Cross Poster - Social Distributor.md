## Description

The proposed project aims to create a cross-service poster that allows users to easily distribute content to a number of Internet Computer (IC) social media services, including but not limited to Distrikt, OpenChat, Taggr, DSCVR.one, and Catalyze. The new application will be designed to be modular so that users can easily add services as they emerge. It would be great if posting to classic social media was an option as well, but posts to those services should include links into the IC based services.

The cross-service poster will be a valuable tool for content creators, enabling them to easily distribute their content across multiple IC services with a single submission. The new application will also include features for registering accounts with each service, making it easy for users to submit content natively to each service.

To create the new cross-service poster, the project will require a team of experienced developers who are proficient in Motoko and have a strong understanding of the IC services ecosystem. The team will work closely with the IC community to ensure that the new application meets the needs of content creators working on the Internet Computer.

The on-chain portion of this application will include a motoko 'wallet canister' that will assume the identity of a user such that all posts to services on the IC will come from that Principal.  This cansister should understand the .did schemas of the different services and process social posts to go across each service.

The off chain portion is a Dapp that lets the user create a post and then format it for each service according to the rules of that service(ie Distrkt is limited to 300 chars but can do multiple posts, taggr may need a place to put custom Tags.).

Overall, the new cross-service poster will provide a valuable resource for content creators working on the Internet Computer, enabling them to easily distribute their content across multiple IC services with a single submission. By incorporating features for registering accounts with each service, the new application will make it easy for users to submit content natively to each service, enhancing the user experience and simplifying content distribution.

## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work building web applications and any other open-source contributions (i.e., your Github).
* Provide a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self-contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

The balance of the bounty will be paid out at completion.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.
