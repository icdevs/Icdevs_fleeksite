## Description

The proposed project aims to create an updated and fully-featured datetime library for Motoko. The current datetime library in Motoko is basic and does not consider time zones, which can lead to inaccuracies in date and time calculations. 

The new datetime library will be designed to be comprehensive and feature-rich, with support for time zones, date and time formatting, and a range of date and time calculations including duration arithmetic. The library will also include support for leap years and daylight saving time, which are important considerations in many applications.

To create this new datetime library, the project will require anf experienced developers who is proficient in Motoko and that has a strong understanding of date and time calculations. The dev will work closely with the Motoko community to ensure that the new library meets the needs of developers working on the Internet Computer.

There are several popular open source DateTime frameworks written in other languages such as Luxon in Javascript, Moment in Javascript and Joda-Time in Java. The new datetime library should be designed taking the best practices and learnings from these libraries while incorporating the unique features and requirements of Motoko.

Overall, the new datetime library will provide a valuable resource for developers working on the Internet Computer, enabling them to create more accurate and reliable applications that consider time zones and other important date and time factors.

The solution should include a significant test suite similar to the test suite of the libraries mentioned above.

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn about Motoko
* learn about DateTime programming


## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work building web applications and any other open-source contributions (i.e., your Github).
* Provide a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self-contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

The balance of the bounty will be paid out at completion.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.
