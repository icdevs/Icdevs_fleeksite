## Description

Motoko needs a more robust text search library.  There are many options to complete this task. The options are: 

1. Create a motoko library written in motoko that can be included in the base libraries for RegEx based text searches.
2. Integrate a native regex library into the compiler as an optional compiler flag(see timer switches)
3. Add generic rust crate integration and imports into the motoko system so that existing rust crates can be included and called from motoko programs.

This is an analysis bounty that asks the developer to review the options and to make a recommendation about the pros, cons, and estimates of doing each three mentioned strategies.

You should work with the motoko team at DFINITY to understand the complications with the different scenarios and understand their priorities as it comes to the future of motoko.  We would like to develop significant motoko compiler experience outside of the Foundation, but we don't want to duplicate work or undertake work that is currently on the road map in the immediate future.

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn about the motoko compiler
* work with the motoko team to understand their priorities
* learn regex

## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work writing tutorials and any other open-source contributions(ie. your github).
* Include a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self-contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

The balance of the bounty will be paid out at completion.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.

## Funding

The bounty was generously funded by the DFINITY Foundation. If you would like to turbocharge this bounty you can seed additional donations of ICP to 8b9cbe90c23b9d0a36006e6623205e89c72938d064c911bdbf4fde9e17280b20.  ICDevs will match the bounty $40:1 ICP for the first 12.5 ICP out of the DFINITY grant and then 0.25:1 after that.  All donations will be tax deductible for US Citizens and Corporations.  If you send a donation and need a donation receipt, please email the hash of your donation transaction, physical address, and name to donations@icdevs.org.  More information about how you can contribute can be found at our [donations page](https://icdevs.org/donations.html).
